# Firmware_Log_Analyzer
A Python-based logging tool that enhances firmware development by providing real-time log analysis for UART Transmission

The below image describes what are the different values that can be sent over UART for a test transmission. These values are sent through a unsigned 8 bit data variable and hence the values are sent as an enum.
